# svg.rx.js-demo

A single-page-application demonstrating the use of [svg.rx.js](https://github.com/akauppi/svg.rx.js/) (GitHub) JavaScript library. 

The project also can be used as a [Svelte 3](https://svelte.dev) / [Routify](https://routify.now.sh/docs/introduction) template. Much details goes into how such projects are built, served at development, and deployed. Here's my take of good practises.


## Requirements

- `npm`


## Getting started

Install the tools and dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

### Launching in dev mode

```
$ npm run dev
...
  Your application is ready~! 🚀

  - Local:      http://0.0.0.0:5000
  - Network:    http://192.168.1.234:5000

────────────────── LOGS ──────────────────
```

This builds the demos and serves them. Changes to the code will be reflected in the browser, without need of refresh. 😏


### Running on a mobile device

Open the mobile device's browser at `http://192.168.1.234:5000` (IP mentioned by `npm run dev`).

This allows you to experiment with the demos.
