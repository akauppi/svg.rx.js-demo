## BUGS 🐞🐞🐞

- No links when opening `localhost:5000`!!! (learn to use Routify)

- `npm run build` doesn't work. Might be a Routify problem?
   - track -> https://github.com/sveltech/routify/issues/73
   - when that works, fix `npm run gh-pages` (depends)

- Try Routify with config from the `package.json`
   - Track -> https://github.com/sveltech/routify/issues/72 (fixed! :)
